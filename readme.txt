ABOUT

Text to Morse is a free tool that you can use anywhere anytime. Just type your text in the box given, and you can copy the results from the result box.
Morse code is a widely used code to transmit data. A dot (.) is one unit, a dash (-) is three units, a slash (/) is silent seven units, and a space ( ) is silent three units.
For example, (.. / .- -- / ... .- --) reads Ta-Ta-7units-Ta-Ta-3units-3units-Ta-3units-Ta-3units-7units-Ta-Ta-Ta-3units-Ta-Ta-3units-3units-Ta-3units-Ta-3units.
The more practice you do, the better you get and understand.
In writing sentences, there's a space between two letters or alphabets, and a slash between two words. In above sentence, it reads "I AM SAM"
